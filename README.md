# Toughest Places to Feed a Family
In the wake of Putin’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine food prices are skyrocketing. 

But this is compounding a crisis that already existed. In March, the UN’s Food Price Index reached its highest level ever, an increase of 30% a year before. 

COVID related supply chain challenges, poor harvests and climate change have played a role in making 2022 a bad year for food. 

Droughts in North and East Africa, a heatwave in India and conflicts in Ethiopia, Yemen and Somalia mean that Putin’s invasion lit a match on an already primed fire. 

In advanced countries, governments have responded with social protection programs to support families struggling with food price increases. But vulnerable countries whose economies have been buffeted by the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and have limited fiscal reserves to respond. 

New analysis from The ONE Campaign presents the worst places to feed a family. It is a ranking of the proportion of the population who are undernourished and the economic scope of the country to respond as measured by its debt sustainability ranking and the extent of its fiscal reserves.
